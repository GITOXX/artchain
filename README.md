# artchain

## What is artchain?

art assets secured on the blockchain

* the world's first asset registry and deed exchange for art assets
* a single, secure marketplace for collectors, art brokers, and artists to exchange art assets with full provenance guaranteed

* secure exchange via smart contracts and escrow accounts all hashed on the blockchain for full satisfaction for all parties from every transaction

* appraisal and conveyancing costs lowered with our distributed provenance ledger
* our distributed reputation system allows great work to gain traction in the marketplace and promotion to a wide public on an intuitive interface

## What has been developed so far?

### artchain marketplace demo
```
the artchain marketplace demo is written in PHP using codeigniter.
We wrote this to demonstrate how an online marketplace can utilise the decentralised data from artchain.
```
[See it in action](http://artchainmarketdemo.artchain.org).

### artchain smart contracts and library.
```
We have build some prototype contracts

[contract]
  |-- .
  |-- [artchain]
          |-- .
          |-- artRegistry.sol
          |--
