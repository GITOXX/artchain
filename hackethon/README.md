 A text file, with each line containing a json result of 5 events from the event feed of hack.ether.camp. the last feed is [page 344](https://hack.ether.camp/api/feed?group=ALL&page=344)

we can find the correlation with events on the smart contract for kudos later on, then find out which votes belong to which facebook id, voting partern and more.
