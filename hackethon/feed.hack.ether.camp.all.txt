Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QcGo25mymno/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA24/UNIYakFrmRU/photo.jpg?sz=300\",\"userName\":\"seesaw_studios\",\"votesAmount\":10}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13863","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13866,"createdAt":1482414598383,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154214035352151/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"mark_edge\",\"votesAmount\":7}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13857","campSlug":"artchain"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=300\",\"userName\":\"tuba_korkmaz\",\"votesAmount\":10}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13847","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13849,"createdAt":1482414268266,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party. In most cases the court would do nothing, but in case of a dispute, the court would arbitrate and give the fund to either the buyer or the seller. <br></li><li>Emergency mechanism in smart contracts. When some funds are at risk or stucked in a smart contract because of conceptual or programming mistakes, the court could agree to move them into a new version of the smart contract. <br></li><li>Neutral party for smart-contract.

The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"/assets/images/profile-img-placeholder.jpg\",\"userName\":\"kabirsingh\",\"votesAmount\":10}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13831","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13832,"createdAt":1482413917934,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

We welcome your feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HAC-lw3MgHlVzdwUeWBaNOjTqW16GQ1MFWQD8sKMV8/edit#<br><br>We created the first smart contract for parametric insurance on the Ethereum mainnet for devcon2 in September. The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10209448252257781/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"dieter\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":545,"userId":27773,"itemId":13810,"createdAt":1482413683672,"text":"Thank you, Dieter! just in time ... <br>","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/145","nickname":"kpi"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13810","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":13813,"createdAt":1482413618391,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10153588216429229/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"arsen_torosian\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13794","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13793,"createdAt":1482412357942,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"220 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/613853562154089/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"guerreiro_capoeira\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13766","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13768,"createdAt":1482411998377,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"220 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

If we\\n imagine our world is an object traveling directly toward a destination \\nof more pollution, hatred, hunger, war and disease, then we can get a \\npicture in our minds of how powerful a force is needed to not only slow \\nthe rate of destruction in our world, but send the world in the \\ncompletely opposite direction. To send it in the direction of health, \\nlove, peace and sharing.<br><br>The strengthening force which will be \\npowerful enough to send the world into the direction of the greater good\\n is known as the \\\"The RevoluXion\\\".</p>\\n<p>We Need More!<br><br>It is time that \\nentities and individuals that are making a positive impact increase the \\nfrequency and sincerity of open discussion about the barriers to \\ncooperation and unity that stifle our collective efficiency.

They need Leaders, laborers and funds as\\n well as strategies and breakthroughs from great and charitable minds. \\nThose in the heat of the battle carry on knowing that the tools that \\nthey need exist but that those who hold the pieces to the puzzle of the \\npower to deliver those tools have not come together for a long enough \\ntime and had the endurance to find a way to see the bigger picture.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/2174825116076071/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"dominic_toretto\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13735","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13734,"createdAt":1482407778350,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10210599616003263/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"saadman_farhad\",\"votesAmount\":220}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13721","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13722,"createdAt":1482407608075,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"300 voted to Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"<div>Oaken is a secure, autonomous, machine to machine platform built to provide the underlying infrastructure(hardware &amp; software) needed to power smart cities.

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party. In most cases the court would do nothing, but in case of a dispute, the court would arbitrate and give the fund to either the buyer or the seller. <br></li><li>Emergency mechanism in smart contracts. When some funds are at risk or stucked in a smart contract because of conceptual or programming mistakes, the court could agree to move them into a new version of the smart contract. <br></li><li>Neutral party for smart-contract. For example in an insurance contract, where the insurer refuse to pay the policyholder, the case would be arbitrated by the decentralized court. <br></li></ul><p><br></p><b>How?</b><br>Smart contract would explicitly allow the court to call some functions. Developers won't have to give it full control on their contracts but they would define in which case arbitration by the court may be necessary.<br><br><b>How to incentivize members to give correct rulings?</b><br>Reputation tokens would be distributed through a crowdfunding, juries would be randomly chosen in proportion of their reputation. Juries voting differently than the majority of juries would loose some reputation (in a manner inspired by SchellingCoin mechanisms).<br>Reputation would be valuable as arbitration fees would be distributed to juries in proportion of their reputation<br>In order to avoid bribes, parties may appeal to a higher number of juries. Ultimately (if someone appeal after all juries have been called), miners would be called and the court could split.\\nIn order to avoid a time consuming process, known arbiters (designed by the parties or elected by the court) could act as a first instance jurisdiction before calling the decentralized court.<br><br><b>White Paper</b> (under construction) : <br><i>https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/whitePaper/DAC.pdf<br><br></i><b>Proof of Concept contract</b>:<br><span><span class=\\\"ng-scope\\\">We put a proof of concept court contract on the testnet:\\n<a href=\\\"https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799</a>\\n<br>Court contract code:\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol</a></span></span><b><br><br></b><br><b>What has been done during the Hackathon:<br></b><ul><li>Wrote a first version of the White Paper.</li><li>Made smart contracts<br></li><ul><li>Made a proof of concept Court contract:</li><ul><li>Callable by arbitrated contract.</li><li>Handling the random drawing of arbitrators and jury members.</li><li>Handling the calls back to arbitrated contracts to enforce the result given by the court.</li><li>Appeal procedure.</li><li>ART token shift according to the coherence of votes.</li><li>(Time logic to be implemented).<br></li></ul></ul><ul><li>Made proof of concept arbitrable contracts:</li><ul><li>Simply changing a state variable according to votes of the court.</li><li>Handling a purchase where funds can be given back to the buyer or the seller depending to the result given by the court.<br></li></ul></ul><li>Found new team members.</li><li>Made three physical presentations of the project:</li><ul><li>La Maison du Bitcoin (https://lamaisondubitcoin.fr/).</li><li>HackerHouse Canal Street (http://www.hackerhouse.paris/hh/canal-street/#hh/canal-street/hackers)</li><li>Blockchain Forum Paris (https://connect.eventtia.com/fr/dmz/coopetition/website)</li></ul><li>Be interviewed by</li><ul><li>Camp Zoom (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPU3zCyPVNg&amp;feature=youtu.be).</li><li>The Ether Review (https://medium.com/the-ether-review/the-ether-review-51-hack-ether-camp-there-can-be-only-one-e3661a4ad25b#.2ufpx0jfy starts at 28:10).</li></ul><li>Made researches on (see White Paper for more details)<br></li><ul><li>Random number generation in a deterministic system.</li><li>Getting the result of computationally intensive tasks on the blockchain in way that wrong results can be challenged and replaced by correct ones.</li></ul><li>Started a web3 GUI (still in progress).<br></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><b>Token</b><b>s</b><i><br></i>\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n<p>We planed to issue a\\ntoken which would be redeemable in exchange of ART (Arbitral\\nReputation Tokens) after our project goes live.<br>\\nHowever, we\\nreviewed the Decentralized Startup Team contract and found multiple\\nvulnerabilities.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/807\",\"userName\":\"Wherefor\",\"votesAmount\":20}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13668","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13667,"createdAt":1482400707920,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"50 voted to Provident – Blockchain backed insurance\",\"description\":\"At Unpatent (https://unpatent.co) we are working on an insurance product to protect against patent troll (or general intellectual property) litigation.\\nWe are developing said insurance fund on top Ethereum in a way that we think is pretty innovative.

The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility.

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f2bLPaFBJro/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAw/a1oB0kvWnP0/photo.jpg?sz=300\",\"userName\":\"ADB\",\"votesAmount\":10}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13598","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13597,"createdAt":1482366515114,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"10 voted to Flood Project\",\"description\":\"<b>ABOUT FKR Tokens:<br><br></b><i>FKR tokens are created as promotional offer for all Hackathon Participants.</i><b><br></b><i>The offer is limited<b> </b>to 50.000 FKR</i><b> </b><i>= max 500 backers</i><b><br><br></b><ul><li><b>BASIC BACKER - BUY 100 FKR and get:</b></li></ul>10 % discount on future ICO (end of&nbsp; January 2016)<br><b><br></b><ul><li><b>HYPER BACKER - BUY 200 FKR and get:</b></li></ul>Same as 100 FKR and:<br><i>1 Certified Custom HyperCoin</i> (like ERC 20 + Hyperfunctions \\nplease check the project including documents at the bottom of the page) \\non commercial HyperLayer with integrated ICO platform. <br>Online and visible from the very first moment after minting.

In applications related to aeronautics, health, and finances, the consequences of software bugs are so severe that a significant amount of effort has been invested in developing automatic methods for ensuring software correctness using formal reasoning\\n\\nOur idea is to make these cutting edge program verification techniques available to smart contracts. We intend to build the Solidifier, a tool for formal verification of Solidity programs.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154853092574287/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"oli_epp\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13532","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13531,"createdAt":1482336529713,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Pollen thank you for buying ICN tokens and supportint camp INCOCHAIN, it truly means the world to us...\",\"description\":\"Pollen thank you for buying ICN tokens and supportint camp INCOCHAIN, it truly means the world to us.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eom5Tq06A14/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACc/a1SZRc5Wku0/photo.jpg?sz=300\",\"userName\":\"lauhim_mahfuz_zishan\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13524","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13523,"createdAt":1482333818721,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Decentralized Court\",\"description\":\"<b>What?</b><br>The decentralized court would act as an opt-in legal crypto-institution.<br>Parties would select the court to arbitrate their contracts in case of disputes.<br>Dispute will be first handled by arbitrators, but parties will have the possibility to appeal to a jury system.<br>Both arbitrators and jury members will have game theoretical incentive to arbitrate disputes in an honest manner.<br><br><b>Use cases?<br></b><ul><li>Escrow system. A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/1904012763163286/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"ciara_leonard-booker\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13494","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13493,"createdAt":1482323508447,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"210 voted to Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"<div>Oaken is a secure, autonomous, machine to machine platform built to provide the underlying infrastructure(hardware &amp; software) needed to power smart cities.

We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154213867923333/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"mike_silveira\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13449","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13448,"createdAt":1482288559521,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Price is set to 1.000\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"MGI\",\"campName\":\"My Global Identity\",\"hkgPrice\":1.0,\"available\":2000000,\"sold\":1020894.7,\"dstAddress\":\"0xad7d88452599efde4ada444b1b810e009d0a42ef\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"PRICE_CHANGED","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13448","campSlug":"my-global-identity"},{"id":13447,"createdAt":1482278609261,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"<div>Oaken is a secure, autonomous, machine to machine platform built to provide the underlying infrastructure(hardware &amp; software) needed to power smart cities.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10207874014320032/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"lizzy_wabissa\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13438","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13437,"createdAt":1482266989269,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"<div>Oaken is a secure, autonomous, machine to machine platform built to provide the underlying infrastructure(hardware &amp; software) needed to power smart cities.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/1828997354043644/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"bessie_chini\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13430","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13429,"createdAt":1482260140250,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"17 voted to etherisc\",\"description\":\"etherisc disrupts insurance by building smart insurance applications on Ethereum and by creating a decentralized marketplace for sharing risks.<br><br>Our whitepaper is now ready in a first version for your review and comments.

When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bqCVFJfeNFk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/QIFNzw96RkE/photo.jpg?sz=300\",\"userName\":\"auryn_macmillan\",\"votesAmount\":60}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13421","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"}]

Financial intermediaries, such as investment banks or hedge funds, do not always adhere to investors’ requirements as there might be conflicting interests.  In addition to that, investors do not have complete transparency over the transactions. Thus, we want to create a distributed autonomous hedge fund in Ethereum, which is (1) able to be more profitable than benchmark indexes and (2) investments follow sustainability criteria that are transparent to the investors. The first objective is a proof-of-concept implementation in the test network of Ethereum.

When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/y3YqR6C.jpg\",\"userName\":\"Simon Schillebeeckx\\r\\n\",\"votesAmount\":100,\"logoUrl\":\"http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SMU_logo.jpg\\r\\n\"}","votesTotal":2,"upvoted":null,"type":"JUDGE_VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":2,"comments":[{"id":410,"userId":26960,"itemId":13405,"createdAt":1482247932732,"text":"Good choice ;)","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/469","nickname":"tyrl"},{"id":414,"userId":27773,"itemId":13405,"createdAt":1482252204672,"text":"Thank you for your votes.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/y3YqR6C.jpg\",\"userName\":\"Simon Schillebeeckx\\r\\n\",\"votesAmount\":100,\"logoUrl\":\"http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SMU_logo.jpg\\r\\n\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"JUDGE_VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":412,"userId":28209,"itemId":13396,"createdAt":1482248069894,"text":"thank you","avatarUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/","nickname":"etherx-dev"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13396","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13395,"createdAt":1482245589546,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 16254 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"CR!\",\"campName\":\"Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"tokensBought\":16254.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.07692307692307693,\"available\":4500000,\"sold\":2331643.894,\"dstAddress\":\"0x620e2e1c44a96bf73439633b43ce26f7640ab41c\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13395","campSlug":"coindashio---stop-managing-your-investments-with-spreadsheets"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/1483101311718309/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"ta_kara\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13387","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13389,"createdAt":1482235276304,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 13 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"CR!\",\"campName\":\"Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"tokensBought\":13.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.07692307692307693,\"available\":4500000,\"sold\":2315389.994,\"dstAddress\":\"0x620e2e1c44a96bf73439633b43ce26f7640ab41c\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13389","campSlug":"coindashio---stop-managing-your-investments-with-spreadsheets"},{"id":13388,"createdAt":1482232616833,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 10 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"ICN\",\"campName\":\"INCOCHAIN\",\"tokensBought\":10.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":10000000,\"sold\":660.01,\"dstAddress\":\"0x987ea5903fa1c718b38ff5087887a2a1ff9225c9\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13388","campSlug":"incochain"},{"id":13386,"createdAt":1482232396732,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"150 voted to Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"<div>Oaken is a secure, autonomous, machine to machine platform built to provide the underlying infrastructure(hardware &amp; software) needed to power smart cities.

For instance, the recent hack in The DAO shows that any program that has not been formally verified is potentially unsafe and can be a big problem for its users. In applications related to aeronautics, health, and finances, the consequences of software bugs are so severe that a significant amount of effort has been invested in developing automatic methods for ensuring software correctness using formal reasoning\\n\\nOur idea is to make these cutting edge program verification techniques available to smart contracts. We intend to build the Solidifier, a tool for formal verification of Solidity programs. Solidifier would be used by smart contract designers to ensure that their code is bug free, guaranteed by a mathematical proof of correctness. We believe that this would increase the quality of the smart contracts deployed in the blockchain, making the environment much safer.\",\"code\":\"SCS\",\"campName\":\"Solidifier - Formal verification of Solidity programs\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/590\",\"avatarUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/LsvzCzR.png\",\"userName\":\"Vlad Cealicu\",\"votesAmount\":60,\"logoUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/cNwhKLs.png\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"JUDGE_VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13308","campSlug":"solidifier---formal-verification-of-solidity-programs"},{"id":13306,"createdAt":1482200957349,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"210 voted to artchain\",\"description\":\"<div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Friends and followers,</font></span><br><span></span><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div dir=\\\"auto\\\"><span><font size=\\\"2\\\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Pleasure\\n to see some of you at artchain's Bash on Friday at which we showed \\nPhilip Firsov's painting oeuvre and hosted Gilbert &amp; George. we \\nanticipate throwing many similar events in the new year if we win the hack.ether.camp competition as part our mission to \\nrevolutionise the art industry with blockchain technology. to do this we\\n need your votes. all the details are below. vote and share.

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone.

We welcome your feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16HAC-lw3MgHlVzdwUeWBaNOjTqW16GQ1MFWQD8sKMV8/edit#<br><br>We created the first smart contract for parametric insurance on the Ethereum mainnet for devcon2 in September. The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"/assets/images/profile-img-placeholder.jpg\",\"userName\":\"flex\",\"votesAmount\":1}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13280","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":13279,"createdAt":1482187316783,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"100 voted to artchain\",\"description\":\"<div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Friends and followers,</font></span><br><span></span><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div dir=\\\"auto\\\"><span><font size=\\\"2\\\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Pleasure\\n to see some of you at artchain's Bash on Friday at which we showed \\nPhilip Firsov's painting oeuvre and hosted Gilbert &amp; George. we \\nanticipate throwing many similar events in the new year if we win the hack.ether.camp competition as part our mission to \\nrevolutionise the art industry with blockchain technology. to do this we\\n need your votes. all the details are below. vote and share.

The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10157850296705577/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"john_o'connor\",\"votesAmount\":210}","votesTotal":2,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13251","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13250,"createdAt":1482155108385,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"17 voted to decentralized hedge fund\",\"description\":\"<br>\",\"code\":\"DZD\",\"campName\":\"decentralized hedge fund\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/25\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/727\",\"userName\":\"REQ\",\"votesAmount\":17}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":393,"userId":27092,"itemId":13250,"createdAt":1482180232854,"text":"thank you!","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/852","nickname":"escursionista"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13250","campSlug":"decentralized-hedge-fund"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10100381204544989/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"tborwick@gmail.com\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":2,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13234","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13233,"createdAt":1482137251545,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to decentralized hedge fund\",\"description\":\"<br>\",\"code\":\"DZD\",\"campName\":\"decentralized hedge fund\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/25\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10208354097786346/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"andco70\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13233","campSlug":"decentralized-hedge-fund"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/LsvzCzR.png\",\"userName\":\"Vlad Cealicu\",\"votesAmount\":7,\"logoUrl\":\"http://i.imgur.com/cNwhKLs.png\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"JUDGE_VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13193","campSlug":"artchain"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10101623995379275/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"david_barton-grimley\",\"votesAmount\":100}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13188","campSlug":"artchain"}]

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/437174980004222/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"franz_zauner\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13171","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":13170,"createdAt":1482059587203,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to artchain\",\"description\":\"<div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Friends and followers,</font></span><br><span></span><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div dir=\\\"auto\\\"><span><font size=\\\"2\\\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Pleasure\\n to see some of you at artchain's Bash on Friday at which we showed \\nPhilip Firsov's painting oeuvre and hosted Gilbert &amp; George. we \\nanticipate throwing many similar events in the new year if we win the hack.ether.camp competition as part our mission to \\nrevolutionise the art industry with blockchain technology. to do this we\\n need your votes. all the details are below. vote and share.

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/827\",\"userName\":\"Liz\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13041","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":13040,"createdAt":1481844913155,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"62 voted to etherisc\",\"description\":\"etherisc disrupts insurance by building smart insurance applications on Ethereum and by creating a decentralized marketplace for sharing risks.<br><br>Our whitepaper is now ready in a first version for your review and comments.

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154799265582360/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"gerry_antworth\",\"votesAmount\":62}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":296,"userId":27773,"itemId":13040,"createdAt":1481869561448,"text":"Thank you!<br>","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/145","nickname":"kpi"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13040","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":13039,"createdAt":1481844133302,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154840341941468/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"abi_browning\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/13010","campSlug":"artchain"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/1503610019654672/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"ella_sbaraini\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12989","campSlug":"artchain"}]

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10209926192045983/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"Miguel Marques\",\"votesAmount\":44}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12978","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":12977,"createdAt":1481761226595,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Price is set to 0.143\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"MGI\",\"campName\":\"My Global Identity\",\"hkgPrice\":0.14285714285714285,\"available\":2000000,\"sold\":1016693.701,\"dstAddress\":\"0xad7d88452599efde4ada444b1b810e009d0a42ef\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"PRICE_CHANGED","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12977","campSlug":"my-global-identity"},{"id":12976,"createdAt":1481759716458,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"210 voted to artchain\",\"description\":\"<div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Friends and followers,</font></span><br><span></span><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div class=\\\"gmail_default\\\"><div dir=\\\"auto\\\"><span><font size=\\\"2\\\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\\\"2\\\">Pleasure\\n to see some of you at artchain's Bash on Friday at which we showed \\nPhilip Firsov's painting oeuvre and hosted Gilbert &amp; George. we \\nanticipate throwing many similar events in the new year if we win the hack.ether.camp competition as part our mission to \\nrevolutionise the art industry with blockchain technology. to do this we\\n need your votes. all the details are below. vote and share.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/761\",\"userName\":\"iLuckStudioArt\",\"votesAmount\":210}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12974","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":12972,"createdAt":1481746693512,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Flood will integrate SEBB (Small Ethereum Bulletin Board - third party), offering automatic decentra...\",\"description\":\"Flood will integrate SEBB (Small Ethereum Bulletin Board - third party), offering automatic decentralized forums to each coin community!\",\"code\":\"FKR\",\"campName\":\"Flood Project\",\"message\":\"Flood will integrate SEBB (Small Ethereum Bulletin Board - third party), offering automatic decentralized forums to each coin community!\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"CAMP_MESSAGE","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12972","campSlug":"flood-project----connect-all-hackethercamp-projects-together"},{"id":12971,"createdAt":1481746627019,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 200 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"TKM\",\"campName\":\"Trustless marketing platform\",\"tokensBought\":200.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":1000,\"sold\":200.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0x8d421ff872b57b2c8a5305dcb2334418928b3c91\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/12971","campSlug":"trustless-marketing-platform"},{"id":12970,"createdAt":1481745946301,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"1 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"BEER_BOUGHT","commentsCount":3,"comments":[{"id":260,"userId":28209,"itemId":12926,"createdAt":1481701610604,"text":"Was it you?

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/1560260727324602/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"mahadi_hasan\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/816","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":815,"createdAt":1481581649977,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Price is set to 0.100\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"VIH\",\"campName\":\"Verieth\",\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":10000,\"sold\":270.01,\"dstAddress\":\"0xf433c1573297e066247d46cc72c2a598f322b3be\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"PRICE_CHANGED","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/815","campSlug":"verieth"},{"id":814,"createdAt":1481580713587,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Project Oaken welcomes you to check out our updated website and video presentation!!

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/\",\"userName\":\"selimcanhotinli\",\"votesAmount\":27}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/806","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":805,"createdAt":1481576450393,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to decentralized hedge fund\",\"description\":\"<br>\",\"code\":\"DZD\",\"campName\":\"decentralized hedge fund\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/25\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154249592812309/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"enrico_dal_monte\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/805","campSlug":"decentralized-hedge-fund"},{"id":804,"createdAt":1481576259952,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 270 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"VIH\",\"campName\":\"Verieth\",\"tokensBought\":270.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":10000,\"sold\":270.01,\"dstAddress\":\"0xf433c1573297e066247d46cc72c2a598f322b3be\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/804","campSlug":"verieth"},{"id":802,"createdAt":1481576159982,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 92 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"PAY\",\"campName\":\"Wepesa\",\"tokensBought\":92.0,\"hkgPrice\":1.0,\"available\":4040000,\"sold\":2560.154,\"dstAddress\":\"0xfb0f7bc291d266dd81825e3f53a7e51f5165bcc7\"}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/802","campSlug":"wepesa"},{"id":803,"createdAt":1481575149915,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New supply, 10000 tokens issued\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"VIH\",\"campName\":\"Verieth\",\"tokensIssued\":10000,\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":10000,\"sold\":0.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0xf433c1573297e066247d46cc72c2a598f322b3be\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"TOKENS_ISSUED","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/803","campSlug":"verieth"}]

For instance, the recent hack in The DAO shows that any program that has not been formally verified is potentially unsafe and can be a big problem for its users. In applications related to aeronautics, health, and finances, the consequences of software bugs are so severe that a significant amount of effort has been invested in developing automatic methods for ensuring software correctness using formal reasoning\\n\\nOur idea is to make these cutting edge program verification techniques available to smart contracts.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/\",\"userName\":\"sambulosenda\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/726","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":725,"createdAt":1481378828753,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 1000 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"tokensBought\":1000.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.001,\"available\":100000000,\"sold\":7.1572603E7,\"dstAddress\":\"0x833882e76f4967b9b18f52d70640bfcc82aa91e9\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":185,"userId":31227,"itemId":725,"createdAt":1481383722554,"text":"Would be interesting to see who raises more funds Wepesa or etherisc","avatarUrl":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/","nickname":"Pesa"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/725","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":724,"createdAt":1481376528989,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 1000 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"LPS\",\"campName\":\"Laundry Princess\",\"tokensBought\":1000.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.001,\"available\":1000,\"sold\":1000.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0x50d04811e28191cfe6d21445bca55f5727dca5c1\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":205,"userId":30524,"itemId":724,"createdAt":1481416167331,"text":"Funding finished? lol","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/720","nickname":"TXC Asia Blockchain Fund"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/724","campSlug":"laundry-princess"},{"id":723,"createdAt":1481374638740,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New supply, 1000 tokens issued\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"LPS\",\"campName\":\"Laundry Princess\",\"tokensIssued\":1000,\"hkgPrice\":0.001,\"available\":1000,\"sold\":0.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0x50d04811e28191cfe6d21445bca55f5727dca5c1\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"TOKENS_ISSUED","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/723","campSlug":"laundry-princess"},{"id":722,"createdAt":1481374148739,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 10000 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"MGI\",\"campName\":\"My Global Identity\",\"tokensBought\":10000.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.001,\"available\":2000000,\"sold\":81193.701,\"dstAddress\":\"0xad7d88452599efde4ada444b1b810e009d0a42ef\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":206,"userId":30524,"itemId":722,"createdAt":1481416222017,"text":"I love your idea.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154674836525729/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"dia_salim\",\"votesAmount\":210}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/713","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":712,"createdAt":1481338077678,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 1001000 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"tokensBought\":1001000.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.001,\"available\":100000000,\"sold\":7.1521603E7,\"dstAddress\":\"0x833882e76f4967b9b18f52d70640bfcc82aa91e9\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/712","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/690\",\"userName\":\"MUK\",\"votesAmount\":210}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/697","campSlug":"artchain"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10211379799830876/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"panos_giannikopoulos\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/660","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":656,"createdAt":1481231742359,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 1010 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"CR!\",\"campName\":\"Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"tokensBought\":1010.0,\"hkgPrice\":1.0,\"available\":1500000,\"sold\":1157.002,\"dstAddress\":\"0x620e2e1c44a96bf73439633b43ce26f7640ab41c\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":145,"userId":27063,"itemId":656,"createdAt":1481270284177,"text":"Thanks for you support!<br>","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/598","nickname":"negedzuregal"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/656","campSlug":"coindashio---stop-managing-your-investments-with-spreadsheets"},{"id":659,"createdAt":1481231708327,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Warning!

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10157744276015005/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"doron_cohen\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/608","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":607,"createdAt":1481184929124,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 2 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"CR!\",\"campName\":\"Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"tokensBought\":2.0,\"hkgPrice\":1.0,\"available\":1500000,\"sold\":57.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0x620e2e1c44a96bf73439633b43ce26f7640ab41c\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/607","campSlug":"coindashio---stop-managing-your-investments-with-spreadsheets"},{"id":606,"createdAt":1481176364119,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 10 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"SRT\",\"campName\":\"Smart Love <3 Ethereum Marriage on SecureScuttlebutt\",\"tokensBought\":10.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.1,\"available\":180000000,\"sold\":10.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0xf32e2d6e8d4d0fd027b39fd3f50e663ddce7a26a\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/606","campSlug":"smart-love-3-ethereum-marriage-on-securescuttlebutt"}]

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10207368280475999/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"ryan_may\",\"votesAmount\":430}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/572","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":571,"createdAt":1481107532443,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"New funding, 50 tokens\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"DEM\",\"campName\":\"Demo Camp\",\"tokensBought\":50.0,\"hkgPrice\":0.2,\"available\":10000,\"sold\":2601.0,\"dstAddress\":\"0xbff552fca8d37cc2312ac9ffbed3142e1e803841\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"FUNDING_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/571","campSlug":"demo-camp"}]

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party.

Ultimately (if someone appeal after all juries have been called), miners would be called and the court could split.\\nIn order to avoid a time consuming process, known arbiters (designed by the parties or elected by the court) could act as a first instance jurisdiction before calling the decentralized court.<br><br><b>White Paper</b> (under construction) : <br><i>https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/whitePaper/DAC.pdf<br><br></i><b>Proof of Concept contract</b>:<br><span><span class=\\\"ng-scope\\\">We put a proof of concept court contract on the testnet:\\n<a href=\\\"https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799</a>\\n<br>Court contract code:\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol</a></span></span><b><br><br></b><br><b>What has been done during the Hackathon:<br></b><ul><li>Wrote a first version of the White Paper.</li><li>Made smart contracts<br></li><ul><li>Made a proof of concept Court contract:</li><ul><li>Callable by arbitrated contract.</li><li>Handling the random drawing of arbitrators and jury members.</li><li>Handling the calls back to arbitrated contracts to enforce the result given by the court.</li><li>Appeal procedure.</li><li>ART token shift according to the coherence of votes.</li><li>(Time logic to be implemented).<br></li></ul></ul><ul><li>Made proof of concept arbitrable contracts:</li><ul><li>Simply changing a state variable according to votes of the court.</li><li>Handling a purchase where funds can be given back to the buyer or the seller depending to the result given by the court.<br></li></ul></ul><li>Found new team members.</li><li>Made three physical presentations of the project:</li><ul><li>La Maison du Bitcoin (https://lamaisondubitcoin.fr/).</li><li>HackerHouse Canal Street (http://www.hackerhouse.paris/hh/canal-street/#hh/canal-street/hackers)</li><li>Blockchain Forum Paris (https://connect.eventtia.com/fr/dmz/coopetition/website)</li></ul><li>Be interviewed by</li><ul><li>Camp Zoom (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPU3zCyPVNg&amp;feature=youtu.be).</li><li>The Ether Review (https://medium.com/the-ether-review/the-ether-review-51-hack-ether-camp-there-can-be-only-one-e3661a4ad25b#.2ufpx0jfy starts at 28:10).</li></ul><li>Made researches on (see White Paper for more details)<br></li><ul><li>Random number generation in a deterministic system.</li><li>Getting the result of computationally intensive tasks on the blockchain in way that wrong results can be challenged and replaced by correct ones.</li></ul><li>Started a web3 GUI (still in progress).<br></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><b>Token</b><b>s</b><i><br></i>\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n<p>We planed to issue a\\ntoken which would be redeemable in exchange of ART (Arbitral\\nReputation Tokens) after our project goes live.<br>\\nHowever, we\\nreviewed the Decentralized Startup Team contract and found multiple\\nvulnerabilities.

We intend to build the Solidifier, a tool for formal verification of Solidity programs. Solidifier would be used by smart contract designers to ensure that their code is bug free, guaranteed by a mathematical proof of correctness. We believe that this would increase the quality of the smart contracts deployed in the blockchain, making the environment much safer.\",\"code\":\"SCS\",\"campName\":\"Solidifier - Formal verification of Solidity programs\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/590\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/636317626548184/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"Ukraine\",\"votesAmount\":5}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/526","campSlug":"solidifier---formal-verification-of-solidity-programs"}]

A buyer and a seller would create a contract where the funds can be retrieved by two out of three parties. The court would be the third party. In most cases the court would do nothing, but in case of a dispute, the court would arbitrate and give the fund to either the buyer or the seller. <br></li><li>Emergency mechanism in smart contracts. When some funds are at risk or stucked in a smart contract because of conceptual or programming mistakes, the court could agree to move them into a new version of the smart contract. <br></li><li>Neutral party for smart-contract. For example in an insurance contract, where the insurer refuse to pay the policyholder, the case would be arbitrated by the decentralized court. <br></li></ul><p><br></p><b>How?</b><br>Smart contract would explicitly allow the court to call some functions. Developers won't have to give it full control on their contracts but they would define in which case arbitration by the court may be necessary.<br><br><b>How to incentivize members to give correct rulings?</b><br>Reputation tokens would be distributed through a crowdfunding, juries would be randomly chosen in proportion of their reputation. Juries voting differently than the majority of juries would loose some reputation (in a manner inspired by SchellingCoin mechanisms).<br>Reputation would be valuable as arbitration fees would be distributed to juries in proportion of their reputation<br>In order to avoid bribes, parties may appeal to a higher number of juries. Ultimately (if someone appeal after all juries have been called), miners would be called and the court could split.\\nIn order to avoid a time consuming process, known arbiters (designed by the parties or elected by the court) could act as a first instance jurisdiction before calling the decentralized court.<br><br><b>White Paper</b> (under construction) : <br><i>https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/whitePaper/DAC.pdf<br><br></i><b>Proof of Concept contract</b>:<br><span><span class=\\\"ng-scope\\\">We put a proof of concept court contract on the testnet:\\n<a href=\\\"https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x4666F54695Df986D58a70089e87422d2462a6799</a>\\n<br>Court contract code:\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">https://github.com/ethercourt/workspace/blob/master/decentralized-court/contracts/Court.sol</a></span></span><b><br><br></b><br><b>What has been done during the Hackathon:<br></b><ul><li>Wrote a first version of the White Paper.</li><li>Made smart contracts<br></li><ul><li>Made a proof of concept Court contract:</li><ul><li>Callable by arbitrated contract.</li><li>Handling the random drawing of arbitrators and jury members.</li><li>Handling the calls back to arbitrated contracts to enforce the result given by the court.</li><li>Appeal procedure.</li><li>ART token shift according to the coherence of votes.</li><li>(Time logic to be implemented).<br></li></ul></ul><ul><li>Made proof of concept arbitrable contracts:</li><ul><li>Simply changing a state variable according to votes of the court.</li><li>Handling a purchase where funds can be given back to the buyer or the seller depending to the result given by the court.<br></li></ul></ul><li>Found new team members.</li><li>Made three physical presentations of the project:</li><ul><li>La Maison du Bitcoin (https://lamaisondubitcoin.fr/).</li><li>HackerHouse Canal Street (http://www.hackerhouse.paris/hh/canal-street/#hh/canal-street/hackers)</li><li>Blockchain Forum Paris (https://connect.eventtia.com/fr/dmz/coopetition/website)</li></ul><li>Be interviewed by</li><ul><li>Camp Zoom (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPU3zCyPVNg&amp;feature=youtu.be).</li><li>The Ether Review (https://medium.com/the-ether-review/the-ether-review-51-hack-ether-camp-there-can-be-only-one-e3661a4ad25b#.2ufpx0jfy starts at 28:10).</li></ul><li>Made researches on (see White Paper for more details)<br></li><ul><li>Random number generation in a deterministic system.</li><li>Getting the result of computationally intensive tasks on the blockchain in way that wrong results can be challenged and replaced by correct ones.</li></ul><li>Started a web3 GUI (still in progress).<br></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><br><b>Token</b><b>s</b><i><br></i>\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n<p>We planed to issue a\\ntoken which would be redeemable in exchange of ART (Arbitral\\nReputation Tokens) after our project goes live.<br>\\nHowever, we\\nreviewed the Decentralized Startup Team contract and found multiple\\nvulnerabilities.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10209854120702682/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"stuart_sheppard\",\"votesAmount\":210}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/490","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":489,"createdAt":1480933293793,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Coindash.io - Stop managing your investments with spreadsheets!\",\"description\":\"<b>Show us some love and vote for us :)</b><div><b>After that visit our website at www.coindash.io</b><br><br></div><div><span>Cryptocurrency investing is a new field, hard and un-explored, you “pick” a coin or an initial-coin-offering(ICO) and Go!<br>How to decide in what to invest?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>COINDASH is the social platform where all types of cryptocurrency investors come together to get market singnals from others, copy-trade superstar investors, share insights about the market, share achievements, share tips, share investment ideas and much much more!<span><br></span></div><div><br><b>Our Team<br></b><ul><li><b>Alon Muroch - </b>Has been in the blockchain space since 2013 when he dived deep into the technology, contributing code to bitcoin, bitcoinj, ethereumj and developing his own super secure wallet BitcoinAuthenticator.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://graph.facebook.com/10154495104086321/picture?height=300\",\"userName\":\"francesca_gavin\",\"votesAmount\":27}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/483","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":482,"createdAt":1480886569147,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"laneyfisher is a new member of Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\",\"description\":\"\",\"code\":\"PEM\",\"avatarUrls\":[\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-w-4OfynivaA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGjg/y4Frb1ICxYQ/photo.jpg?sz=300\"],\"usernames\":[\"laneyfisher\"],\"campName\":\"Project Oaken - Hardware Oracle Prototype by Ethembedded.com\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"MEMBER_JOINED","commentsCount":4,"comments":[{"id":57,"userId":26960,"itemId":482,"createdAt":1481210776386,"text":"Looking forward to check it :+1:<br>","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/469","nickname":"tyrl"},{"id":60,"userId":28327,"itemId":482,"createdAt":1481210972777,"text":"Thanks for the interest, we will keep you posted!","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/658","nickname":"PhonikG"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/482","campSlug":"project-oaken---hardware-oracle-prototype-by-ethembeddedcom"},{"id":481,"createdAt":1480884691567,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"Published a new presentation\",\"description\":\"<div>Time is one of the most important resources, and everyone is born with it!&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>WeQuest is time-banking&nbsp;DAPP designed to help people connect with each other, to exchange goods and to provide services using time as currency, thus <b>without</b> the need of monetary transactions.<div><br></div><div><div>As our 'quest for we' starts with the people in need, our first use case is for refugee camps, where people have a lot of time and skills but are not able to use them.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/\",\"userName\":\"teledisko\",\"votesAmount\":1}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/456","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":457,"createdAt":1480726177199,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"1 voted to A prototype of a decentralized political party\",\"description\":\"Currently the political system is undergoing a crisis of trust in many countries both in the developed, and developing world.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail.

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone.

For instance, the recent hack in The DAO shows that any program that has not been formally verified is potentially unsafe and can be a big problem for its users. In applications related to aeronautics, health, and finances, the consequences of software bugs are so severe that a significant amount of effort has been invested in developing automatic methods for ensuring software correctness using formal reasoning\\n\\nOur idea is to make these cutting edge program verification techniques available to smart contracts. We intend to build the Solidifier, a tool for formal verification of Solidity programs. Solidifier would be used by smart contract designers to ensure that their code is bug free, guaranteed by a mathematical proof of correctness.

It is easy to estimate the value of a Twitter or FB post, of an account having N follower, etc. But users who contribute to the content and the success of the portal/app are not rewarded on it's value.\\n\\n\\nPROPOSED SOLUTION:\\nWe propose to create a set of tokens (ERC20 compatible) to reward user generated content. So that any project can issue it's own tokens to reward it's contributors. This may completely change how value is redistributed among project's investors and contributors. \\n\\nInvestors of the project may acquire the same tokens seeing them as company's / project's shares.

The flight delay dapp is online at https://fdd.etherisc.com and combines a fully automated insurance process on the blockchain with a great user experience.<br><br>The logical next step and our goal for hack.ether.camp is to create the investor's side to have the full process for sharing risks end-to-end on the blockchain.<br><br>Risk is traditionally shared in an inefficient, intransparent, and \\nclosed insurance market which is dominated by few large players. We want to create a decentralized marketplace for risks on the Ethereum blockchain which is autonomous, transparent and accessible to anyone. When customers share risks, e.g. with the flight delay dapp, investors can buy these risks, represented by tokens, with incentives aligned and balanced by self-adjusting smart contracts.<br><br>If you want to support our development, please vote for our camp and back us with buying RSC tokens.<br>\",\"code\":\"RSC\",\"campName\":\"etherisc\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/553\",\"avatarUrl\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/551840283944833024/PypNjvCM_normal.jpeg\",\"userName\":\"bamos\",\"votesAmount\":5}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":24,"userId":27773,"itemId":238,"createdAt":1480243115170,"text":"thank you!<br>","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/145","nickname":"kpi"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/238","campSlug":"a-truly-decentralized-p2p-insurance"},{"id":237,"createdAt":1480117978677,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"5 voted to Nebulis: A distributed directory built on Ethereum\",\"description\":\"On October 1st, 2016, governance of the ICANN is being handed from the US to the UN, which means users of the Internet are no longer protected by the first amendment which guarantees free speech for all.

Currently, the art market suffers from incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Establishing the authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leads to artificially raised costs of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ against fraud.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Transaction of art assets is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similar tangible asset classes ‒ land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Such certification cannot exist using legacy technology due to the compromises of private information it would entail. The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together, with the new consensus artchain can provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facing the future of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For an MVP we are producing an app with a smart contract back-end.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>\",\"code\":\"ART\",\"campName\":\"artchain\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/116\",\"avatarUrl\":\"api/files/images/119\",\"userName\":\"art unchain'd\",\"votesAmount\":110}","votesTotal":1,"upvoted":null,"type":"VOTES_GIVEN","commentsCount":null,"comments":null,"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/216","campSlug":"artchain"},{"id":215,"createdAt":1480083006712,"jsonData":"{\"header\":\"110 voted to Solidifier - Formal verification of Solidity programs\",\"description\":\"The bugs in the software we use in our everyday life have the potential of causing a lot of harm to us all.

In applications related to aeronautics, health, and finances, the consequences of software bugs are so severe that a significant amount of effort has been invested in developing automatic methods for ensuring software correctness using formal reasoning\\n\\nOur idea is to make these cutting edge program verification techniques available to smart contracts. We intend to build the Solidifier, a tool for formal verification of Solidity programs.

Now they can each send their combined secrets to&nbsp;<strong>Craig</strong>&nbsp;as confirmation tokens and go back to their normal lives. If either party reports that something seemed 'wrong' then that suspicion is flagged for verification by others in a shorter time. &nbsp;False attestations or attempts to game the system will result in damage to the users reputation.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Footnote:&nbsp;</b></p><p>Accounts will be paired by geographic location which means that communities (or users) in the middle of no where may have to boot strap from nothing.

Consultancy in the form of \\\"lawyers\\\" are hired to interpret the law which means that increased legal complexity also increases the demand for services in a very inefficient cycle. LegalZoom through a first mover advantage has monopolized the automation of legal proceedings online and while some services are very complex, LegalZoom has represented the difficulty of some their offers. \\n\\nX is a new legal company which plans to take on competitors like this by offering basic legal services, paid for by Ether. Trademarking an image, software, license, or even process is actually a fairly simple matter, and so we will start with this process in this camp. \\n\\nThe process of trademarking on X is  in two stages. The first stage is through a simple web GUI which converts images/files/pictures in datasets converted to SHA256. The second step is a drag and drop smart contract that simulates the USE of the mark, which arguably makes this possible only on chains like LSK or ETH. The contract itself would allow jurisdiction to \\\"see\\\" the simulated use of the image by executing its contract. For example, a step smart would include a two part payment gateway online which would demonstrate ecommerce functionality thereby allowing someone to trademark a ecommerce site logo. \\n\\nIt is without contestation that there have been large inefficiencies in the automated legal space with has not lead to the advances we should have seen in small business legal proceedings that is why, assuming legality is a critical part of any financial system that this could be the most important space we need to be exploring with new blockchain technologies. \\n\\nFor more information feel free to visit the website.\",\"code\":\"XXX\",\"coverUrl\":\"/api/files/images/294\",\"campName\":\"X.Trademark\"}","votesTotal":0,"upvoted":null,"type":"CAMP_CREATED","commentsCount":1,"comments":[{"id":340,"userId":26960,"itemId":94,"createdAt":1482074965756,"text":"I have tried to email you directly but&nbsp;<br>the domain says to be dead","avatarUrl":"api/files/images/469","nickname":"tyrl"}],"urlForShare":"https://hack.ether.camp/feed-item/94","campSlug":"xtrademark"}]

Matching is based on the best price in the market: greatest Bids, and least Asks processed first. The exchange cleans stale orders after each matching cycle to maintain a light ledger. \\n\\n2) Escrow contacts are created for each market order to house Eth(Bids) or Digital Tokens(Asks).

The unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing. artchain ‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once artchain has been established, the art market can be securitised, which has heretofore been an impossibility.
