  "description": "The art industry is rife with undetected fraud. Currently, the art market suffers from              incompleteness of information due a lack of trust among its participants. Establishing the             authenticity of art assets is expensive and often disputed which leadstoartificiallyraisedcosts               of conveyancing in an attempt to protect ‒ imperfectly ‒ againstfraud.Transactionofartassets                is regulated neither by deed nor by a public ‘art registry’ unlike similartangibleassetclasses ‒                 land &amp; vehicles ‒ which are exchanged more reliably &amp; frictionlessly. Such certification cannot              exist usinglegacytechnologyduetothecompromisesofprivateinformationitwouldentail.The               unique property of the blockchain is its ability to provide immutable proof that x is y using a                  distributed ledger, unmatched cryptographic security, and smart contract conveyancing.         artchain ​‒ a gold standard certification system for art assets ‒ can harmonise the art market                with its analogues, preserve the security of private ownership information, and provide all             counterparties the guarantee that they will come out of a transaction with satisfaction. Once              artchain​has been established,theartmarketcanbesecuritised,whichhasheretoforebeenan               impossibility. This is the Blockchain Revolution. Together,withthenewconsensus​artchain​can             provide, we can build a coalition of art industry professionals and participants facingthefuture               of mutual self-regulation of transactions and provenance.",
